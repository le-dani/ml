Gaussian Naive Bayes Email Classifier

Description
This file contains a Python implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for the purpose of classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories. The classifier uses a dataset of emails, processes the textual content, and trains a machine learning model to predict the classification of new email instances.

Libraries

The following libraries are required to run this code:
- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- scikit-learn (for the Naive Bayes algorithm and accuracy assessment)

## Versions
The code was last tested using:
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of text files representing emails, organized into directories for spam and not spam. It is assumed that the dataset is pre-split into training and test sets.


Installation and Execution
To run this program, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. Update the `TRAIN_DIR` and `TEST_DIR` variables in the script to point to your training and test email directories, respectively.
